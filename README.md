# Python Terminal Game Minesweeper

This portfolio project is a program that simulates the game Minesweeper through the terminal. Through the numbered menus, users can read the rules of the game, sign in, view stats, play a new game, or save and quit. Each turn in the game, users enter the information of the row and column of the tile they want to uncover or flag. After playing a game, the program will save the user's win/loss data by writing to the user_info.csv file.

## Getting Started

### Installing
You can select "Clone Git Repository" on an IDE of your choice with this link (https://github.com/NickChadha/Python-Terminal-Game-Minesweeper.git) or run the following terminal command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NickChadha/Python-Terminal-Game-Minesweeper.git
```

In the terminal, run the following to activate the environment:

```sh
environment\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Finally, make sure your interpreter is set to 'environment' and run the main.py file (any other Python file will work, too).
